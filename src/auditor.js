 This program simulates a "data collection station auditor", which joins a multicast
 group in order to receive measures published by thermometers (or other sensors).
 The measures are transported in json payloads with the following format:
{"uuid":aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60,"instrument":"piano",
"activeSince":2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z}

 Usage: to start the auditor, use the following command in a terminal

   node auditor.js
